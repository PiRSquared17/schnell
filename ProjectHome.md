Schnell covers a set of core components and tools for integrating wiki ([Google Code Wiki Syntax](http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax)) parsing and formatting into all sorts of applications, from simple tools to entire webs. Schnell is not currently intended to be an entire wiki system in itself.

Schnell is primarily written in C# 2.0 and targets the .NET platform.
